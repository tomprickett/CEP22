\begin{abstract}
  Development projects in which small teams of learners build software / digital products are very common features of computing related degree programmes. Assuring fairness in assessment within these courses is a challenge to ensure students are fairly rewarded for the extent of contribution they make to the collective team effort. During this process maintaining gender parity is clearly a critical aspect of fairness. This paper presents the process within one such project which uses the Team-Q metric \cite{Britton2017} and analyses the impact of the self-declared gender of marking and marked peer on the peer scores obtained. The results are indicative of the scheme in this context displaying gender parity.  The paper makes the case for continued vigilance in this area to ensure Team-Q and other schemes are used in a context that support gender parity.

\section{What is it?}	
%%A short description of the practice you're presenting
\label{sec:What}
In the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions Computing degrees regularly contain courses in which teams of learners develop software / digital products. Commonly this enables the development or enhancement of various software engineering competencies for example; analysis and design; implementation; testing; configuration management / version control; team work; project management / control etc. Such teamwork projects are not universally well received by all students \cite{Gordon2010}, however there is an employment related dimension \cite{Thomas2003} to the development of these competencies and they are required inclusions by the related professional bodies\cite{Crick2020}. 

Within these team projects, all members of the teams are expected to contribute to the the development of the software / digital products. Sometimes the contribution is structured in some manner by task, by role etc, in other projects the teams are more self-managing. Assuring fair contributions from all learners can present challenges \cite{Philips21}. One approach to help to address this challenge is the use peer assessment \cite{Gordon2010}, with one common approach being to ask learners to indicate the relative contributions to the project. This can be achieve by online tools such as WebPA \cite{WebPA}, or BuddyCheck.io \cite{BuddyCheck} or SparkPlus \cite{SparkPlus} or via the use of surveying tools such as Google or Microsoft forms. In many cases the learners are required to assess their peers contributions by a set of criteria, commonly in the form of questionnaire.  In generic terms the algorithm commonly adopted is then:

\begin{itemize}
\item Each learner scores each of their peers in their team by a set of metrics. 
\item A weighting is then calculated by \[ Mean Peer Score for the learner \div Mean Peer Score for the whole team\]
\item The individual learner would then be awarded the mark the team is award multiplied by this weighting.
\end{itemize}

Such team projects commonly have individual assessed components as well as team responsible assessed components and it would normally only be the team components that would be subjected to the weighting.

Clearly the criteria used will have a significant influence on the weighting and hence potentially the grade awarded to the individual learners.  Given the number of individuals who inform the marking (i.e. all the learners) their is more potential for unconscious or conscious bias to influence the marking than if the marking was completed solely by faculty. This paper explores if a validated   criteria namely Team Q \cite{Britton2017} together with a specific set of practices supports gender parity in terms of the peer assessment marks awarded.  Team Q \cite{Britton2017} assesses 5 components of team working: Contributes to team project; Facilitates contributions of others; Planning and management; Fosters a Team Climate; and manages potential conflict. Each of the components is in turn measures by indication of \textit{'how often does your peer demonstrate the following}' against a set of descriptions. Each description is awarded scores as can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:scores}. The full set of descriptions can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:means}.  Hence a learner scores each of their peers out of 56 overall. The peer weighting is then calculated using the algorithm indicated previously ( A learners mean peer score divided by their teams mean peer score). 
The Team Q peer model produces a team work marking via a marking scheme synthesised from wider research. In so doing it presents a comprehensive model for what constitutes effective team working. One of the outcomes of this, is to highlight to learners a rounded model of what competencies constitute good quality team working and these are far from solely technical competencies. The authors contend this provision of a benchmark for good team working practice provides useful formative feedback for the learners as they complete the projects in their teams.

\section{Why are you doing it?}
%%What happened before? What is it changing / replacing / improving? What gap is it filling?
It is commonly recognised that Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) (for example \cite{Baird2018}) and more specifically computing remain male-dominated disciplines. In the United Kingdom (UK) fewer than 1 in 5 Computing and Engineering and Technology students were female in the academic year 2019-20 \cite{HESA}. In computing in the UK 26285 out of 105485 (just less than 20 \% identified as female) and 210 identified as non-binary \cite{HESA}. Addressing this imbalance is critical for the disciplines involved as is articulated in the United Nations Sustainability Goals 4 Quality Education and Goal 5 Gender Equality \cite{UN} and essential to maximise the potential future development of the discipline.

Belonging \cite{Veilleux2013} is recognised as a crucial factor for retaining learners within the computing. Learners who self-identify as women have been reported to have a lower sense of belonging \cite{Mooney2020}. The challenges face by female students related to belonging has also been qualitatively explored \cite{Winter2021}. None of which makes for comfortable reading and clearly highlights the need to carefully evaluate whether education practices promote belonging, support diversity, and gender parity. Whilst there is always the need to assure gender parity in assessment, in this case when learners are contributing to the assessment processes of their peers the the need to assure the process used exhibits gender parity is particularly strong. 

The peer assessment is the main focus of this work. However it is acknowledged the data is being gathered as part of assessed tasks which may in some way influence the outcomes. Additionally, more details of the full practices adopted are provided as different results may arise if the scheme was applied in different assessment situations.

\section{Where does it fit?}
%%A short description of your teaching context. You may, for instance, include a description of intake, class size, curriculum sequence; anything that's necessary for others to understand your situation. How do things work at your institution?
The Team Projects run as part of the final year of a Computer Science undergraduate degree at a University in the United Kingdom. The study took place in the academic year 2020-21 under the constraints of the Covid-19 pandemic. This required more virtual working than in other deliveries. The course runs between January and April over a 15 week period including a 3 week spring vacation. The study has the approval of the ethics board.  As part of the peer assessment learners were asked to indicate "What gender do you identify as?" as an optional free text field, additionally they were specifically asked to indicate their consent to be included in the study. Hence learners have the opportunity to not supply the information and additionally their consent for inclusion in the study was explicitly sought. Those who provided a null response have not been included in the study. The size of the cohort was 170. Of these 121 learners are included in the study with 108 learners self identifying as male ('male' or 'man' or 'masculine') and 13 self identifying as female. A further 3 learners identified responded as non-binary ('I dont know', 'non-binary' and 'nothing' ), these have not been included in the study due the concerns they may be individually identifiable.

In brief the key aspects of the management of the projects are handled as follows
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {Team allocation.}
The learners are allowed to alternatively self select their teams or choose to be assigned to one. Teams are normally of a size of 5. If learners wish to be assigned a team, these are allocated randomly upon a first come, first served basis. 
\item {Project selection.}
All the projects are 'live' development projects in the sense the teams develop a software product for a third party. Some of the projects are self-sourced by the learners. Additionally, the teaching team assists some teams in identifying suitable projects. 
\item{Learning Agreements.}
As part of the establishment of teams, the teams are required to write a learning agreement which documents key decisions regarding how the team will collaborate to complete the work. Teams are encouraged to reflect upon this agreement as the projects progress. A writing frame is provided posing key questions the learning agreement should address. 
\item{Development approach.}
The teams are required to follow a full-stack development approach with each team member developing a subsystem that they can ultimately demonstrate individually if so required. However the teams are encouraged to be able to demonstrate an integrated working product and are rewarded for doing so as part of the marking rubric. If presenting an integrated working product is not possible for reasons beyond an individual learners control (for example a passenger in a team) adjustments are made accordingly so that a learner is not unfairly penalised.
\item{Support.}
The teams are supported by weekly progress review meetings with a tutor. These meetings follow a stand-up style with each team member asked to identify progress and any road blocks which can then be discussed in more depth. A Microsoft Word template and a InVision Freehand \cite{InVision} template were provided to support this activity. These records where uploaded to the Virtual Learning Environment at the end of the meetings.

Outside of the meetings, the supervising tutor attempted to support the teams resolved any team related issues. For a small number of groups this involved removing a team member for serial non-engagement with either the supervision meetings or more importantly engagement with the team.
\item{Assessment.}
There are three related components of summative assessment: a project proposal (10\%), a demo of the software (50\%) and a critical report which evaluates the project and the professional, ethical, legal and social issues a finalised and deployed version of the produced prototype would need to mitigate. 50\% of the proposal and 20\% of the demo are given as team marks which are weighted by peer assessment.
\item{Peer Assessment.}
The project proposal and the demonstration contain team and individual task. As such peer assessment is employed to ensure a fair split of marks between the team. Over the various historical deliveries of the course alternative technologies have been used to administer the peer assessment including paper, virtual learning environment tools and other electronic tools. In the year, in question the peer assessment was administered by Microsoft Forms. The scheme used was Team Q \cite{Britton2017}.

The response to Team-Q were analysed using a combination of Excel and R. Excel was primarily used for storage and data manipulation. R was used for the statistical analysis. 

The means for the responses to the different descriptions in the Team-Q metric are shown in the Table~\ref{tab:means}. From the table it can be seen there appears to be little difference in the mean peer marks awarded between Female marking male, male marking female or male marking male pairs (Means 46.407, 46.2259 and 47.216 respectively). This is confirmed with an Analysis of variance test (Markers Gender F-value =0.104 p=0.748 and Marked Gender F-value= 0.177 and p=0.674). Whilst the number of female to female marking pairing was relatively low, the mean is higher however it is not statistically significantly different to the other scores as can be seen from a T-Test (T-Statistic = 0.697, P = 0.487). Together this provides confidence that the peer assessment metric adopted in this case (Team-Q) appears to exhibit gender parity in terms of the gender of marker or the gender of the marked. This is a sample size of 121 learner on one course deliver with a low incidence of female to female marking but even so the results are encouraging


\section{Who else has done this?}
%%Where did you get the idea from? (If from published reports, please include references). How did you find out about it? Was it easy/hard to adopt? What did you change?
Peer assessment and related web-based peer assessment has been advocate as a mechanism for equitable assessment of contribution to team and team software development projects for a number of years \cite{Clark2005,Raban_Litchfield_2007, Gordon2010,Fagerholm, Britton2017,Philips21}. The exact mechanism varies but as indicated previously it common involves learners assessing their peers by a given metric, calculate team average and then weight marks accordingly. It has also been reported that bias is common when it is used in a summative context that learners to do want to award a low mark to their peers and understandably particularly their friends \cite{Sridharam2003}.  Bias in peer assessment on the basis of gender has been reported \cite{Heels2019,Stonewall2018} and elsewhere bias has not been evidenced \cite{Tucker2014,Falchikov1997}. This mixed picture highlights the need to validate tools employed in different contexts to assure the process exhibits gender parity.

\section{What will you do next?}
%%Will you vary this, or develop it further?
The authors acknowledge that there are some advantages to using the existing online peer assessment tools and at the time of writing the aspiration is to employ the Team-Q regime within the BuddyCheck.io tool for the next delivery.

It is possible that the remote learning required in the Covid-19 pandemic may have influenced the results, as such the intention is to repeat the study with this years cohort to determine if the results are reproducible in more typical learning conditions.Clearly, this is one course at one university. As such the study will be extended to other courses at the university and potentially other courses at other institutions again to explore if the outcomes are reproducible in different circumstances. The focus of the study to date has overlooked non-binary learners due the the risks related to identification of individual learners. Consideration needs to be made for how the impact upon non-binary learners can be explored.

It has been reported that self-identified minorities can have a lower sense of belonging \cite{Mooney2020}. Learners may identify as minorities for reasons other than gender. Consideration of the impact of other factors and how these may impact upon peers assessment is also something intended to be explored.

Finally, since there are performance benefits associated with Diverse teams \cite{HBR206}, exploring the impact of team diversity upon peer assessment and overall achieved grades makes for an interesting area for further exploration.


\section{Why are you telling us this?}
It is encouraging that there was evidence of gender parity within the peer assessment scheme adopted for this delivery. However it is noted that this is for one cohort at one university, using full stack development during the global Covid-19 pandemic. As such a wider investigation into the impact of alternative process (fully self managed teams for example) and whether the Team-Q criteria maintain the absence of bias. Arguably Team-Q is a well considered algorithm which explores more dimensions team working than some of the more standard approaches that are embedded in existing tools such as Web-PA \cite{WebPA}and buddycheck.io \cite{BuddyCheck}. Although such tools could easily be configured to use the Team-Q scheme or other scheme as an alternative to their default.

Given the low over-head of evaluating the impact of self-identified gender upon peer assessment results, doing so is a practice recommendation for the occasions when peer assessment is employed.

Finally, gender parity is far from the only possible dimension of parity that could be exhibited in peer assessment approaches such as this one. This points to a rather urgent set of work to assure assessment remains equitable.
