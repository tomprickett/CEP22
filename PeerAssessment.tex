\begin{abstract}
	Development projects in which small teams of learners develop
	software/digital artefacts are common features of computing-related
	degree programmes. Within these team projects, it can be problematic
	ensuring students are fairly recognised and rewarded for the
	contribution they make to the collective team effort and outputs. Peer
	assessment is a commonly used approach to promote fairness and due
	recognition. Maintaining parity within assessment processes is also a
	critical aspect of fairness. This paper presents the processes
	employed for the operation of one such team project at a UK higher
	education institution, using the Team-Q rubric and analysing the
	impact of the (self-identified) gender of learner marking and the
	learner being marked on the scores obtained. The results from this
	institutional sample (N=121) using the Team-Q metric offers evidence
	of gender parity in this context. This study also makes the case for
	continued vigilance to ensure Team-Q and other rubrics are used in a
	manner that supports gender parity in computing.

\section{What is it?}	
%%A short description of the practice you're presenting
\label{sec:What}
In the UK and other jurisdictions, computing degrees regularly
require teams of learners develop software/digital
artefacts. This commonly involves the demonstration of various
software engineering competencies; for example, analysis and design;
implementation; testing; configuration management and version control;
team working; project management/control,
etc~\cite{davenport-et-al:latice2016}. Such projects are not
universally well-received or well-regarded by
students~\cite{Gordon2010}; however there is an employability-related
dimension~\cite{Thomas2003, Mitchell2021} to the development of these
competencies, as well as required characteristics for professional
body degree accreditation~\cite{Crick2020}.

\looseness=-1
Within these team projects, all members of the teams are expected to
contribute to the development of these software/digital
artefacts. Contribution may be structured in some manner by task, by
role, etc; in other projects, the teams are more
self-managing. Commonly, there will be some expected collective
outcomes such as a product (e.g. common look and feel, an integrated
product, etc) or task-based (e.g. risk analysis, project plan, team
demonstration of the product, etc).  In addition to the collective
tasks there may be individual tasks which again could be product
(e.g. building of sub-system X) or task-based (e.g. testing of the
product). Assuring fair contributions from all learners to collective
tasks can present challenges~\cite{Philips21}. One common approach to
address this challenge is peer assessment~\cite{Gordon2010}. It has
been reported that peer assessment: is appreciated by learner as a
mechanism to hold members accountable and aid fairer marking; supports
giving and receiving feedback; prompts personal reflection and
improvement; supports supervision; informs project planning and
management; facilitates exploring and reshaping group dynamics;
improves project outputs; and offers a sense of safety to raise issues
without repercussions~\cite{Mitchell2021}. Various peer assessment
schemes which are based upon peer ranking, holistic view or peer
rating, and category based~\cite{Yanbin2005, Lejk2001} have been
proposed. One common form of peer rating/category system is for
learners to assess their peers by a given metric, calculating means
for individual and teams, and then weighting collective marks
accordingly. This can be achieved by online tools such as
WebPA~\cite{WebPA}, BuddyCheck.io~\cite{BuddyCheck}, or
SparkPlus~\cite{SparkPlus} or via the use of online surveying
tools. In general terms, the algorithm commonly adopted is then:
({\emph{i}}) each learner scores each of their peers in their team by
a set of metrics; ({\emph{ii}}) a weighting is then calculated by Mean
Peer Score for the learner divided by Mean Peer Score for the whole
team; and ({\emph{iii}}) the individual learner would then be awarded
the mark that team is awarded multiplied by this weighting. Such team
projects commonly have individual assessed outcomes as well as team
responsible assessed outcomes and it would normally only be the team
outcomes that would be subject to the weighting.

\looseness=-1
Clearly the criteria used has a significant influence on the weighting
and hence potentially the grade awarded to the individual
learners. Given that all of the learners contribute to the marking,
there is more potential for unconscious or conscious bias to influence
the marking than if the marking was completed solely by faculty. This
paper, building on recent
work~\cite{crick-et-alassessposter:sigcse2022}, explores whether a
validated approach -- Team Q~\cite{Britton2017} -- together with a
situated set of practices, supports gender parity in terms of the peer
assessment marks awarded.  Team Q~\cite{Britton2017} assesses five
components of team working: contributes to team project; facilitates
contributions of others; planning and management; fosters a team
climate; and manages potential conflict. Each of the components is in
turn measures by indication of `{\emph{how often does your peer
demonstrate the following}}' against a set of descriptions. Each
description is awarded scores as follows: Never=0; Sometimes=1;
Usually=2; Regularly=3; and Always=4. The full set of descriptions can
be seen in Table~\ref{tab:means}. Hence a learner scores each of their
peers out of 56 overall. The peer weighting is then calculated using
the algorithm indicated previously (with a learner's mean peer score
divided by their team's mean peer score).

\section{Why are you doing it?}
%%What happened before? What is it changing / replacing / improving? What gap is it filling?
It is widely recognised that STEM~\cite{Baird2018} and more
specifically computing remain male-dominated disciplines. In the UK,
only 1 in 5 Computing, Engineering and Technology students were female
in the 2019-2020 academic year~\cite{HESA}. For the computing
discipline in the UK, 26,285 out of 105,485 (just less than 20\%)
identified as female and 210 identified as
non-binary~\cite{HESA}. Addressing this imbalance is critical for the
disciplines involved, from a social, cultural and economic
perspective, to maximise the potential future development of the
discipline. This is further reinforced by the ambitions of the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals: {\emph{SDG4: Quality
Education}} and {\emph{SDG5: Gender Equality}}.

Belonging~\cite{Veilleux2013} is recognised as a crucial factor for
retaining learners within the computing discipline, yet learners who
self-identify as women have been reported to have a lower sense of
belonging~\cite{Mooney2020}. The challenges faced by female students
related to belonging has also been explored by qualitative
studies~\cite{Winter2021}. Together, this highlights the need to
carefully evaluate whether assessment practices promote belonging,
support diversity, and gender parity. Whilst there is always the need
to assure equity in assessment, in this case when learners are
contributing to the assessment processes of their peers the need to
assure the processes used exhibits gender parity is particularly
strong.

Peer assessment is the main focus of this work; however, it is
acknowledged the data is being gathered as part of assessed tasks
which may, in some way, influence the outcomes. Additionally, more
details of the situated practices adopted are provided as a context.

\section{Where does it fit?}
%%A short description of your teaching context. You may, for instance, include a description of intake, class size, curriculum sequence; anything that's necessary for others to understand your situation. How do things work at your institution?
The team project is run as part of the final year of an undergraduate
Computer Science degree at a UK higher education institution. The
study took place in the 2020-2021 academic year between January and
April over a 15-week period including a 3-week spring vacation, under
the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic. Institutional ethical
approval for the study was obtained. Explicit written consent was
obtained as part of the peer assessment learners were asked to
indicate ``What gender do you identify as?'' as an optional free text
field; additionally, they were specifically requested to approve their
consent to be included in the study. Hence learners have the
opportunity to not supply the information and additionally
specifically consent to participate. Those who provided a null
response have not been included in the study. The size of the cohort
was 170. Of this group, 121 learners are included in the study with
108 learners self-identifying as male (`male' or `man' or `masculine')
and 13 self-identifying as female. A further three learners identified
responded as non-binary (responding: `I don't know'; `non-binary'; and
`nothing'); these have not been included in the study due to concerns
that they may be individually identifiable. The key aspects of the
management of the projects are as follows:

\textbf{Team allocation:}
The learners are allowed to either self-select their teams or choose
to be assigned a team. Teams are normally comprised of five
individuals. If learners wish to be assigned a team, these are
allocated randomly upon a first-come, first-served basis. In this
case, three teams were allocated randomly, these were exclusively male
teams.

\textbf {Project selection:}
All the projects are `live' development projects in the sense that
teams develop a software/digital artefact for a third-party. Some of the
projects are self-sourced by the learners, some are tutor sourced.

\textbf{Learning Agreements:}
As part of the establishment of teams, the learners are required to
produce a learning agreement which documents key decisions regarding
how the team will collaborate to complete the work. Teams are
encouraged to reflect upon this agreement as the projects progress. A
writing frame is provided posing key questions the learning agreement
should address.

\textbf{Development approach:}
The teams are required to follow a full-stack development approach
with each team member developing a subsystem that they can ultimately
demonstrate individually if required. However, the teams are
encouraged to demonstrate a fully-integrated working product and are
recognised for doing so as part of the marking rubric. If presenting
an integrated working product is not possible for reasons beyond an
individual learner's control (for example, there is a passenger in the
team) adjustments are made so that a learner is not unfairly
penalised.

\textbf{Support:}
The teams are supported by weekly progress review meetings with a
tutor. These follow a stand-up style with each team member asked to
identify progress and any road blocks which can then be discussed in
more depth. A Microsoft Word and a InVision Freehand template were
provided to support this activity. These records were uploaded to the
institutional virtual learning environment at the end of
meetings. External to the meetings, the supervising tutor attempted to
support the teams to resolve any team-related issues; one team had to
be reorganised in this delivery.

\textbf{Assessment:}
There are three related components of summative assessment: a project
proposal (10\%), a digital product and related demonstration (50\%)
and an individual report which critically evaluates the project and
the professional, ethical, legal and social issues a finalised and
deployed version of the produced prototype would need to mitigate. The
team aspects are: 50\% of the proposal and 20\% of the digital product
and related demonstration which are marked as a team and are weighted
by peer assessment.

\looseness=-1
\textbf{Peer Assessment:}
The project proposal and the demonstration contain team and individual
tasks which are peer assessed. Over various historical deliveries of the
course various technologies have been used to administer the peer
assessment including paper, virtual learning environment tools and
other electronic tools. In this delivery, peer assessment was
administered by Microsoft Forms. Two rounds of peer assessment were
completed, one formative and one summative. Only the summative round
is included in the study.

\section{Does it work?}	
%%How do you know? Give some evidence of effectiveness in context
The responses to the Team-Q rubric were analysed using a combination
of Excel (data storage and cleaning) and R (statistical analysis). The
Team-Q Score, number of marks awarded, and means for responses to the
different descriptions in the Team-Q rubric by the gender of the
marked learner and by the gender of the marker pairing are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:means} above. There is little statistical difference in
the mean of Team-Q Score for the marks awarded to female (46.94) and
male (47.15) leaners (t-test {\emph{t}}=-0.087708, {\emph{df}}=35.438,
{\emph{p}}=0.9306). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggests little
statistical difference in the mean Team-Q Score awarded between
``female-marking male'' (46.41), ``male-marking female'' (46.30) or
``male-marking male'' (47.22) pairs (markers gender {\emph{F}}=0.104,
{\emph{p}}=0.748 and marked gender {\emph{F}}= 0.177,
{\emph{p}}=0.674). The slightly higher female-to-female marking
pairing mean (50.60) is not statistically significantly different to
the other pairings (t-test {\emph{t}}=0.697, {\emph{p}}=0.487).  This
is a sample size of N=121 learners on one course delivered with a low
incidence of female learners (13) but is supportive of gender parity
in terms of the gender of the learner being marked and gender of the
learner completing the marking.

\section{Who else has done this?}
%%Where did you get the idea from? (If from published reports, please include references). How did you find out about it? Was it easy/hard to adopt? What did you change?
Peer assessment and related web-based peer assessment has been
advocated as a mechanism for equitable assessment of contribution to
team and team software development projects for a number of
years~\cite{Lejk2001,Clark2005,Raban_Litchfield_2007,
Gordon2010,Fagerholm, Britton2017,Philips21}. When peer assessment is
used in a summative context, there can be bias due to affiliation with
a group~\cite{Cestone2008}, and learners sometimes do not want to
award a low mark to their peers (and particularly to their
friends)~\cite{Sridharam2003}. Bias in peer assessment on the basis of
gender has been widely reported~\cite{Heels2019,Stonewall2018}, and
elsewhere bias has not been evidenced
\cite{Tucker2014,Falchikov1997}. The performance benefits associated with
diverse teams are also reported. This mixed picture
highlights the need to validate tools employed in different contexts
to assure the process exhibits gender parity.

\section{What will you do next?}
%% Will you vary this, or develop it further?
The study will be repeated in more typical learning conditions as the
COVID-19
pandemic~\cite{crick-et-al:ukicer2020,watermeyer-et-al:he2020,crick-et-ala:iticse2021}
may have influenced the results. The sample size is small, including
only a small number of female learners hence growing the sample size
may increase confidence in the results. Learners may identify as
minorities for many reasons (e.g. gender (including non-binary),
ethnicity, neurodiversity, no family history with higher education,
etc) and considering all such factors is an area for future
work. Statistical parity, is one thing, learner perceiving assessment
to be fair is equally critical. Learner perceptions present an urgent
set of research work to supplement quantitative with qualitative data
via interviews with learners to explore their view of inclusion and
whether there are perceptions of micro-aggressions or bias in team
activities.

\section{Why are you telling us this?}
The Team Q peer model produces a team work weighting via a marking
scheme synthesised from wider research, and thereby it presents a
comprehensive model for what constitutes effective team working. Its
usage highlights to learners the broad set of competencies that
constitute good quality team working which are not solely technical
competencies~\cite{Thomas2003,Crick2020,prickett-et-al:iticse2020,Mitchell2021}. The
authors contend this provision of a benchmark for good team working
practice provides useful formative feedback for the learners as they
complete the projects in their teams.  Limitations discussed in the
previous section not withstanding, it is encouraging that there was
statistical evidence of gender parity within the peer assessment
scheme in this context. Team-Q is a well-established rubric which
explores more dimensions of team working than some of the more
standard approaches that are embedded in existing
tools~\cite{WebPA,BuddyCheck,SparkPlus} by default. Finally, given the
low overhead of evaluating the statistical impact of self-identified
gender upon peer assessment results, doing so is a practice
recommendation.
